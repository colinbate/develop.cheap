It bills itself as part database and part spreadsheet, and you can certainly see elements of both as your get started with Airtable. Unlike many services which start to charge once you want to move beyond a single user, Airtable is free for teams to use, just limiting the size of each of your 'bases'. But with an unlimited number of bases, you can still do a lot without paying anything.

Each of your bases can be set up with any number of fields, and rendered in multiple ways, be it a grid, a gallery, an entry form, or even a Kanban board. This means that not only will it store your data, but it will let you collect and visualize it far more pleasantly than any spreadsheet I've ever used before.

One of the best parts of the service is that your data is accessible via an API, allowing you to use Airtable as a backend for your website or application.
